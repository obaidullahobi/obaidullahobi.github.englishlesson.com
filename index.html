        <h3>a short review</h3>
        <p>it is a movie review regarding the danish military in the hard situation.
            it was made in 2009 in hellmand afghanistan,which is southern of afgahnistan.
            the base name was FOB Armadillo (forward operation base);
            in the movie i can see, before the soldiers are going down into the village the platoon commander 
            is taking thier followers photos.
            so now they are prepared to go out on a patrol and the patrol commenced from the highground(desert)
            ,there are a few children is runing closer to ISAF and they are looking for something to eat,and one of the 
            soldier is giving a choclate for girl.i can see the soldires are fully equiped with body armour,helmet,weapon,magazines,
            camelbage,mendal boots,RPR which they are saying for radio communication,military clothes.
            when the soldires are comming down into the village.the taliban started thier contact with ISAF.
            i can see the soldier is getting down to save himself and the ISAF soldires also started to fight with taliban.
            the contacts started both side.the taliban took the position in the highground cave and ISAF down in the harvest fields.
            the ISAF parked thier tanks on the highground and firing toward the enemies position.and i can also see the soldiers 
            is runing to th save place where they can protect themself from bullets.when they find a compound the started again fighting.
            because there were positioned another group of the taliban  into the village .the ISAF used the detonater 
            to breach the wall and to get into the house.when the fighting stopped,then the ISAF spotted some of the insurgents
            in the area and they putted a bomb on them.so when the soldiers returned save to the base,they started to clean thier weapons.

        <h3>a soldier where i worked with at the same unit</h3>
        <p>it is the video from 2010 where i have worked as an interpreter at this unit,
            it was a supply unit which was called force protection group.
            thier mission were  to deliver foods and other equipments to the different bases.
            i was the one which was going out most of the time with them.
        </p>
        <h3>my experience from this video</h3>
        <p>it is my great and unforgetable experiences through my job as an interpreter.
            we were driving once a week there which was not far from the small bases.i think the small bases were 
            50km away from the main base. it was taking about 6 and 7 hours to get the small bases destination because there were placed many bombs in the ground
            so that was why taking long time to drive until the destinations.therefor they were using
            the mines detector to sweep the ground from the mines.
            this incident occured on the way we returned from the small base called armadillo
            which was located to the North of the main base.
            there were blew up the Danish APC by bomb and three danish soldires were seriously injured.
            so this singer decided to make a song about soldiers.
